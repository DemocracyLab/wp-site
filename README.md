==========

This is the dev version of DLab's WP site which is hosted at OSUOSL. Please make your own branch to contribute, and name a reviewer before you merge code. If you haven't met us in Seattle, feel free to fork and make a pull request. 

Currently, we're working on a new home page and some functionality for surveys of existing deliberative projects. DLab's theme is custom, and a child theme. You'll need a MAMP, LAMP, or WAMP stack to code on this, but designers and content writers are welcome to contribute as well. Contact DemocracyLab here on github if you need help getting setup or want guidelines on how to create assets or copy. 

If you're a beginner at WP and working on a Mac there's a one step setup for a MAMP stack via the WP codex: http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_Locally_on_Your_Mac_With_MAMP

To install on Windows http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_on_Microsoft_IIS
